Hi everyone and welcome to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). This is where I'll be keeping track of my progress, trying new things and maybe learning a thing or two.

## Goals

This year's objectives are (as of Nov 21st, 2022):

* Try my hand at writing tests (and maybe even Test Driven Development, if I can find the time).
* Maybe branching languages a bit. So far I've attempted AoC with C#, maybe I'll add other languages into the mix this time around, let's see.
* Learning some of the features recently introduced in C# 11/.NET 7
* (Optional:) Implement a "framework" I can use in future AoC's to achieve my goals faster.
